# CNN_Visualizer
 
Visualize the internal workings of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

This project is an extension of this jupyter notebook I wrote: https://github.com/charliedavenport/LeNet-MNIST-Demo to produce this gif: https://gfycat.com/affectionatememorablegreyhounddog-artificial-intelligence-neural-networks

My goal is to create a python app for deep-learning visualizations across multiple models and datasets.
